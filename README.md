X3D-Kinect-Scripts-Various
==========================

Various Scripts and belonging Java(script)code to be used with InstantReality (http://www.instantreality.org/). Tested with version 2.2.0.24818.
Can't get new InstantReality versions to work with OpenNI anymore. Kinect for Windows SDK 1.6 used instead.

No fancy magic super code here, just a little playing around with X3D.

Kinect-SDK_Node_Skelet_and_Cursor.x3d
* Renders a Skeleton as used in the Kinect SDK, Codebase is the old Kinectsample from InstantReality (http://www.instantreality.org/kinect/)

Nodeskeleton.js
* Renders a Skeleton as used in the Kinect SDK

RightHand3DCursor.js
* Uses JointPositions and delivers a single SFVec3f for translationspurposes
